    <h2>Get to know us</h2>
    <h3>Forging pathways toward a just and sovereign <br>food system in Nigeria.</h3>
    <p>
      Tomajok Farms plays a vital role behind the scenes to strengthen our local food system. 
      We serve as a connector, bridging the gap between producers and consumers by aggregating, storing, processing, distributing,
       and marketing local food. By providing infrastructure and support services, we enable small-scale farmers and food producers to reach wider markets and achieve economic viability. 
      Through partnerships, we aim to make local foods accessible to all members of our community. Our activities promote sustainability, enhance community resilience, and foster a healthier, more equitable food system.

      <p>Our journey began six years ago when Ms Disu, inspired by a love for the land, took the leap to build a farm that would nourish both the body and the soul. What started as a small plot of land has now grown into a thriving farm, but the mission has remained the same—to provide fresh, locally grown produce while caring for the environment.
        At Tomajok farms, we believe that healthy food starts with healthy soil. That’s why we prioritize organic farming methods and sustainable practices to ensure that our land stays vibrant for generations to come. From the moment the seeds are planted to the time the crops reach your table, every step of the process is done with love, care, and attention to detail.
        We’re proud of the strong community we’ve built with our customers, neighbors, and fellow farmers. Together, we support a more sustainable food system that benefits everyone. Whether you’re visiting our farm stand, picking up your weekly produce box, or enjoying a farm-to-table experience, we’re honored to be a part of your journey toward healthier living.

  <div class="p-div"><p>
 our experience is more than just the journey of a farm—it’s a testament to our deep-rooted commitment to sustainability, community, and the health of the land. Founded in 2019 by Mariam Omobolanle Disu,
  what began as a simple vision to reconnect with the earth has grown into a thriving farm that produces a wide variety of organic crops for our local community. With a firm belief that healthy food starts with healthy soil,
   we’ve dedicated ourselves to farming in harmony with nature. From day one, we adopted sustainable farming practices, ensuring that every seed we plant, every crop we grow, and every harvest we bring in is done with care for the environment and respect for the land that feeds us.
We are passionate about preserving the integrity of the soil, water, and air that sustain us, which is why we use organic, non-GMO seeds, practice crop rotation, and prioritize regenerative farming methods. 
Every part of our farm is an expression of this care—whether it's the vegetables we grow, the animals we raise, or the diverse ecosystems we protect. We’re not just about producing food; we’re about creating a balanced ecosystem where the land, the plants, and the animals thrive together.

  <div class="p-div"><p>
    Over the years, we’ve expanded our efforts, but our mission has never wavered: to grow healthy, organic food with respect for nature, while promoting practices that ensure the vitality of the land for generations to come.
     We are proud to operate with sustainable, eco-friendly farming methods, using natural fertilizers and crop rotation to preserve soil health and reduce our environmental footprint.
      Beyond the produce we grow, we believe in fostering a connection between people and their food, which is why we open our doors to the community, hosting farm tours, educational events, 
      and farm-to-table experiences that allow others to learn about where their food comes from. Our journey is about more than just farming—it's about building a sustainable future, supporting local economies,
       and encouraging a healthier lifestyle for everyone. At Tomajok farms, we’re not just growing food, we’re cultivating a way of life that values quality, care, and connection. We invite you to join us on this journey, 
       as we continue to nourish the land, our community, and all who enjoy the bounty of what we grow.
